# ANN-PONR-Python3

This Project was created during a seminar thesis (wie zum Geier hei√üt das?!) in a tenth grade.

It contains a game file (PointOfNoReturn.py), a Neural Network file (ArtificalNeuralNetwork.py, the heart of the project) and a Reinforcement Learning Agent (ReinforcementLearningAgent.py) to control the Network.
Fully trained ANNs can be found in the folder Finished-ANNs.

We used tkinter for the graphical user interface and numpy for the needed matrix calculation.
Although we could have used a fully working ANN API like Tensorflow, we wanted to create an own one to learn how it works.
